# SudokuBot

## Development setup:

```
$ ./setup
```

Wow! That was easy.

## Configuration:

So like... open the file CONFIG in your favourite text editor. It will look
something like this:

```
API_HOST="https://matrix.org/_matrix/client/api/v1"
USER_ID=""
ACCESS_TOKEN=""
```

This next bit is insanely complicated: put the _userID_ you made for the bot
(they look something like "@username:matrix.org") inside the quotes beside
_USER_ and the _access token_ inside the quotes beside _ACCESS_TOKEN_.

### BUT WAIT!! WHAT IF I DON'T KNOW MY ACCESS TOKEN?

That's cool. Use this handly utility to grab your credentials:

```
$ ./login
```

This will prompt you for your user id and password. Use these values for your
CONFIG file.

### BUT WAIT!! WHAT IF I DIDN'T REGISTER A NEW USER FOR THE BOT?

Well download a client from [here](https://matrix.org/blog/try-matrix-now) and signup.

## Running

This is a hard one too:

```
$ ./run
```

Whoa.  Crazy shit.

## Playing the Game

First, invite the bot to your room or start a chat with it.  If the bot is
running, it will automatically accept the invite.

Then, you can play the game with these commands:

	+ `!sudoku new`
		+ Starts a new game.
		+ If there is already a game being played: *are you sure?* `!sudoku yes`
	+ `!sudoku restart`
	+ `!sudoku solve`
		+ Solves the puzzle for you and shows you the answer.
	+ `!sudoku <row><col> <number>`
		+ Where _row_ can be letters A-I
		+ Where _col_ can be numbers 0-8; and
		+ Where _number_ can be numbers 1-9

I'm sure you cna take it from here ðŸ˜‰ 

## TODO:
	
	+ Make a script to login and generate CONFIG file for us.
	+ Maybe make a bin/ folder?
	+ Perhaps move the CONFIG file somewhere else?
	+ Maybe an install script so we don't run the bot within repo folder?
